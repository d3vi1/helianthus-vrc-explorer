# B524 Namespace Invariants

This document is the implementation-facing contract for B524 namespace behavior.
User-facing guidance in `README.md` should reference this document and only describe
behavior that is already stable in code/tests.

## Scope

- Applies to scanner planning/discovery, artifact schema, browse/report identity, and fixture migration.
- Covers register families (`0x02`, `0x06`) and the `0x01` constraint probe scope decision.
- Uses `opcode` as canonical namespace identity; labels like `local`/`remote` are display metadata.

## Invariants

1. Opcode-first identity is mandatory.
   - Namespace key: `<opcode>` (for example `0x02`, `0x06`).
   - Canonical register identity tuple: `(opcode, group, instance, register)`.
   - Any GG-first fallback that can merge/opacify namespaces is invalid.

2. Discovery is advisory, not semantic authority.
   - GG directory probe (`opcode 0x00`) results are evidence for discovery flow only.
   - Semantic identity, namespace topology, and row identity are not derived from descriptor values.
   - **Ban:** GG discovery MUST NOT be used as semantic authority.

3. Constraint scope is explicitly `opcode_0x02_default`.
   - Decision: `opcode_0x02_default`.
   - Rationale: the bundled static catalog is seeded from `0x01` probe evidence, but it is only trusted for opcode `0x02` by default.
   - Outcome: remote opcode `0x06` does not inherit seeded static constraints unless a constraint entry explicitly scopes into that namespace or a live probe confirms it.

4. Artifact identity keys are namespace-aware.
   - Persisted topology authority: `groups[*].dual_namespace` plus `groups[*].namespaces` (when present).
   - UI/report dedupe key contract: `<group>:<namespace>:<instance>:<register>`.
   - Path contract: `B524/<group-name>/<namespace-display>/<instance>/<register-name>`.

5. Fixture compatibility is migration-based, not semantic rewrite.
   - Current artifact schema: `2.2`.
   - Legacy unversioned/`2.0`/`2.1` fixtures are migrated in-memory with register-count preservation.
   - Migration may normalize container shape, but must not drop register entries or collapse namespace identity.
   - Legacy mixed-opcode single-group artifacts are rendered split-by-namespace in browse/report consumers.

## Historical Context

Issues #120 and #125 remain useful exploratory context (how we reached the namespace split), but they are not active semantic authority. The active authority is:

- current code behavior in this repository,
- tests/fixtures that validate it,
- and this invariants contract.

When historical notes conflict with current contract, follow current contract and open a corrective docs issue/PR.

## Protocol Notes Implemented In Explorer

These notes are scanner/register-map behaviors implemented in this repository only.
They are observational and do not replace the opcode-first identity contract above.

1. OP `0x06` generic device-header registers (`RR=0x0001..0x0004`) are mapped experimentally.
   - Generic rows are provided for `device_connected`, `device_class_address`, `device_error_code`, and `device_firmware_version`.
   - Group-specific rows (for example GG `0x09`/`0x0A` radio fields) remain authoritative when present; wildcard header rows are fallback only.
   - On BASV2, this generic header is not evidence for a remote `GG=0x00` namespace. Heat-source inventory is 1-indexed:
     - `GG=0x01` / `OP=0x06` = primary heat source (type 1)
     - `GG=0x02` / `OP=0x06` = secondary heat source (type 2)
   - `GG=0x00` remains local-only on BASV2 and should not be scanned as a remote namespace.

2. GG `0x09` is dual-use by opcode namespace.
   - OP `0x02`: local control/write-path style registers (for example quick-mode related control path).
   - OP `0x06`: remote radio-device inventory/status registers.
   - GG identity must never be merged across opcodes.

3. The DT byte (RK) is an effective 2-bit reply-kind field (`0..3`).
   - The numeric domain is shared across opcodes, but bit0 semantics are opcode-specific.
   - OP `0x02`: bit1=config, bit0=volatile/stable.
     - `0`: `simple_volatile`
     - `1`: `simple_stable`
     - `2`: `config_volatile`
     - `3`: `config_stable`
   - OP `0x06`: bit1=config, bit0=invalid/valid data.
     - `0`: `simple_invalid`
     - `1`: `simple_valid`
     - `2`: `config_invalid`
     - `3`: `config_valid`
   - Scanner artifacts expose `reply_kind` while preserving legacy `flags_access` labels for compatibility.

4. Register response-state is wire-level and explicit (`active | empty_reply | nack | timeout`).
   - `empty_reply` (ACK + `NN=0`) is canonical artifact state; it is rendered as “empty reply / dormant”.
   - `nack` and `timeout` are protocol states, not generic transport-error strings.
   - `error` is reserved for genuine transport/decode failures outside those four states.

5. Sentinel `0x7FFFFFFF` is annotated when decoded as integer payload.
   - Artifact entries expose `value_display="sentinel_invalid_i32 (0x7FFFFFFF)"` for this case.
   - This is scanner-layer annotation only; semantic/runtime policy outside explorer belongs to gateway/poller repos.

6. The previous ISC KNX heat-source assumption is corrected for BASV2: the remote heat-source groups are 1-indexed, not 0-indexed.

7. Register-map notes carried in explorer:
   - `GG=0x03`, `RR=0x0007` is mapped as hypothesis `zone_window_open` with provisional `F32` decoding.
   - `OP=0x06`, `GG=0x01` heat-source notes are tracked for:
     - `RR=0x0001` (`heat_source_device_connected`)
     - `RR=0x0002` (`heat_source_device_address`)
     - `RR=0x0003` (`heat_source_device_status`)
     - `RR=0x0012` (`heat_source_active_errors`)
     - `RR=0x0015` (`heat_source_flow_temperature`)

8. Canonical operation labels are opcode-first:
   - `0x00`: `QueryGroupDirectory`
   - `0x01`: `QueryRegisterConstraints`
   - `0x02/0x00`: `ReadControllerRegister`
   - `0x02/0x01`: `WriteControllerRegister`
   - `0x03`: `ReadTimerProgram`
   - `0x04`: `WriteTimerProgram`
   - `0x06/0x00`: `ReadDeviceSlotRegister`
   - `0x06/0x01`: `WriteDeviceSlotRegister`
   - `0x0B`: `ReadRegisterTable`
